# INFO 330: Database Systems and Data Modeling
## Group Project
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to give you hands-on experience in database development. The process of database development goes through phases from conceptual design to implementation and maintenance of the database. The design phase can particularly be very challenging since it is less structured. Specifically, the project will reinforce the following learning objectives:
- Evaluate information needs of the target organization, and effectively model the data using entity-relationship model and the relational model.
- Design and implement a physical model based on principles of relational database design, and organizationâ€™s needs regarding data, data organization, and data storage.
- Develop working SQL statements for simple and intermediate queries to create and modify data and database objects to store, manipulate, and analyze company data.
